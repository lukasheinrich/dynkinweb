small demo of computing group theory things all from dynkin. currently only shows root and fundamental lattices.

ideas could include:
* [jeu-de-taquin](jeu-de-taquin.herokuapp.com) style rep via weyl character formula and Freudentahl multiplicity formula
* weight lattices for quotient groups i.e. SO(4) as Spin(4)/Z_2 etc
